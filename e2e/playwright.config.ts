/**
 * Playwright config (hardening B + spec 14 §3):
 *
 * - DEFAULT (ephemeral): the webServer is the real Fastify app booted against
 *   in-memory PGlite by @payroll/server's e2e:serve script (migrations +
 *   seeds + fixtures; serves the built SPA from apps/web/dist).
 * - LIVE QA (E2E_BASE_URL set): no local server is booted — the suite runs
 *   against that URL (the nightly job sets it from the QA_E2E_BASE_URL repo
 *   variable; unset → ephemeral default).
 *   Fixture-driven specs branch: journeys are ephemeral-only; the qa.spec
 *   specs use the documented seeded QA credentials/TOTP and stay read-only.
 *
 * - WALKTHROUGH (E2E_WALKTHROUGH=1, spec 20): a separate, NON-gating re-run of
 *   the journey files at human pace — slowMo, per-character typing, screen
 *   holds (tests/support/walkthrough.ts) — recorded and joined into one video
 *   per journey by reporters/walkthrough-reporter.ts. Ephemeral boot ONLY: it
 *   refuses to start when E2E_BASE_URL is set. Its output lives apart, in
 *   test-results-walkthrough/, so it never mixes with the gating evidence.
 *
 * Chromium only; serial (journeys share the single in-memory database).
